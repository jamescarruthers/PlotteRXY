## End Cap Options

For a standard build you want to use the 4 x plain end cap.

For a 4WD build where you have motors at either end then choose either hole or XH. Depending on how you want to route your wires, you might want to use a mix of the plain and the end cap with XH or holes.

The XH variant has a slot that you can push an XH connector through - the most common type of connector on a stepper motor.

The hole variant is just a plain 4mm hole that you can put cables through.
