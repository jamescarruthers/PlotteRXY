There are a few different options for drive and pulley configurations depending on what you want to achieve.

V2 is suggested for new builds as it's a much neater layout, allowing one end of the plotter to be free of belt and any kind of wiring.

## V1 Original

* 2 x stepper mount
* 2 x pulley mount

## V1 with 4-wheel-drive

* 2 x stepper mount
* 2 x stepper corner mount

## V2

* 2 x stepper corner mount
* 2 x pulley mount

## V2 with central drive

* 1 x central drive
* 4 x pulley mount

This configuration mounts the two steppers together, place it in the middle of the rail.


## 4-wheel-drive tensioning procedure

Use the following procedure to make sure the pulley teeth are synchronised.

1. Power off the plotter.
2. Disconnect the two 4WD steppers from the controller board and loosen the two grub screws on both the 4WD pulleys.
3. Adjust the tension on both belts.
4. Power the plotter on.
5. Ensure the 4WD pulleys are engaged with the belt.
6. Tighten the grub screws on the 4WD pulleys, ensuring that they are not tightened against the flat of the D shaft. The pulley should not move as you tighten the grub screws.
7. Power the plotter off.
8. Reconnect the 4WD steppers.
9. Power the plotter on.
