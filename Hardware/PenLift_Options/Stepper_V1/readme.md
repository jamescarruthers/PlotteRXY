# Stepper pen lift

Additional components required:

* Nema 17 stepper motor - pick the slimmest and lightest you can find
* 20t pulley - same used on the belt drive steppers
* 4 x 605Z bearings - same as used on all other pulleys
* 9mm 2GT belt - same as used for the drive belts
* 2 x 3mm spacers or 6 x 1mm spacers - same as used on all other pulleys
* 2 x 16mm M5 for pulleys
* 1 x 5mm t-nut - same as used for securing everything else to aluminium rail
* 1 x LWL7B 55mm guide rail - same as the solenoid lift
* 1 x limit switch and associated wiring - same as used on the limit switches for the X and Y axis
* 1 x M5 bolt for pen holder
* 2 x 605 bearings for the pulley keeper - this is the same as the rest of the plotter BUT without the flange
* Various M2 and M3 screws to mount the arm, penholder, limit switch and stepper motor

The pulley keeper should not be tight, it should just sit on the belt.

The belt should be installed with the adjustment pulley to the left, move the pulley to the right to loosen and enable "drop" mode.

The screw tip is a very basic item to put on the end of the pen holder bolt - it's a clumsy solution at the moment.
