This is currently experimental and untested.

This mount replaces the standard pulley mounts.

You do not need these mounts if you are only running two motors. If you plan to upgrade to 4WD later then you can use these mounts without the motors.

Use the following procedure to make sure the pulley teeth are synchronised.

1. Power off the plotter.
2. Disconnect the two 4WD steppers from the controller board and loosen the two grub screws on both the 4WD pulleys.
3. Adjust the tension on both belts.
4. Power the plotter on.
5. Ensure the 4WD pulleys are engaged with the belt.
6. Tighten the grub screws on the 4WD pulleys, ensuring that they are not tightened against the flat of the D shaft. The pulley should not move as you tighten the grub screws.
7. Power the plotter off.
8. Reconnect the 4WD steppers.
9. Power the plotter on.
